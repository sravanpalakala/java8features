Factory pattern
The Factory pattern is one of the creational design patterns. The factory design pattern lets you create objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client. The created objects share a common interface used by the client to interact with them. That is, the factory creates one of a family of objects and the client is not aware of the object's specific subclass type. The instantiation of the appropriate object is based on the arguments passed at the factory's object creation method. One of the examples of this pattern in JDK, is the java.util.ResourceBundle class which returns the appropriate bundle through the getBundle() method.

At the Factory pattern the following components are participating:

The factory, creates one of a family of objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client.
The family of objects, the objects share a common interface (interface or abstract class).

                                          `. +--------+
                                            \| type n |
                                             +--------+
Test case
In our scenario, suppose that there is a company that constructs two computer models, the 'home' and the 'server' model. The production of its model is based on the respective specifications that dictates what are the parts that the model consists of; for example, the number of cores. disks and the memory. The client can order a computer by simply specifying the model and not the specification details.

Adapting our scenario to the Factory pattern results to the following components mapping:

Factory ---> ComputerFactory
Family objects' common abstraction ---> Computer
Family object 1 ---> HomeComputer
Family object 2 ---> ServerComputer
Discussion
The Factory pattern implementation using lambdas differs from the old approach that the family objects' builders (constructors, builder methods) can be lambdas that conforms to some interface and returns a new object. Note that the lambda approach doesn’t scale very well if the factory method needs to take multiple arguments to pass on to the object's 'builder'. In case of multiple arguments a custom functional interface should be created with the respective parameterized types.
